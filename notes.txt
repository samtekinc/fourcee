 trigger an execution of a module propagation
  - pull list of downstream OUs from propagation
  - extract all associated accounts from OUs
  - fetch all active module-account-associations for the propagation
  - determine diff between associated accounts and active module-account associations:
    - for associated accounts with no active module-account-association, create one
    - for active associations with no corresponding associated account in the propagation, deactivate the association & run tf destroy
  - for all active (new or existing) module-account-associations:
    - execute terraform plan/apply

module-account-associations
 - primary keys are module propagation ID & org account ID
 - tracks the association status of a module to an account, based on some propagation
 - gets created when a module propagation is executed
 - is never deleted, only transitioned into a deleted status while maintaining record

module-propagation-executions
 - primary keys are module propagation and execution id
 - tracks tf executions via grouping key
